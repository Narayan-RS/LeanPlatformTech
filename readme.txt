Respected Sir/Ma'am

	I hope this message finds you well. First of all I am thanking for selecting me for the assignment session. I have created  the webpage as per the requirements. 

For the best viewing experience use any browser with zoom of 67%. Maximum try to use a PC. In the webpage, I have assigned the login button like, as soon as we click the login button, it gets redirected to the main page. In the main page the calender events are only given to the Tue(3) schedule. 

Please feel free to contact me if any modifications required I'm eager to further discuss how my skills align with the requirements of the position front end intern position.

Best Regards
